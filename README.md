# Dotfiles

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my personal dotfiles github repository. Feel free to copy, paste, and use anything you find here to customize your own setup!

### A Quick Note:
- Issues are closed because this is a personal public repo.
- Pull Requests are ignored for the same reason.
- Discussions is always open! Feel free to stop by if you'd like to chat or share ideas.

### Required Package:
- python
- trash-cli

### Other Note:
Just in case you interesting with other package that I use.
You can found it on [scripts/package.py](https://github.com/rifwin/Dotfiles/blob/main/scripts/package.py)

I really want to implement nix os style sync package.
But since I try to keep all python scripts self contained, that one will be hard to implement.
So currently we have to manually remove the package name from package.py then uninstall it manually.

Thanks for stopping by and checking out my dotfiles! ðŸŽ‰  
Happy customizing, and I hope you find something useful here.  
Feel free to join the discussion if you want to chat or share ideas. ðŸ˜Š
